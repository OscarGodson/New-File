# OSX Apple Right Click New File

Tested With El-Capitan 10.11, Sierra 10.12 & High Sierra 10.13

## What
New File is simply an AppleScript Automator Workflow that enables a right click context menu option to allow you to create a new file and rename it all in one action.
## Why  
New File isn't a default option on Mac, but it is on Windows and most Linux distros. There have been others who've done stuff like this, but they either open open modals, or are set with key commands and other unintuitive or intrusive methods. This is meant to be just like Windows and Linux.
## Install
Amazingly simple.

- Download the the source, or clone it
- Once downloaded, double click on the `New File.workflow` file and wait for Automator to open. 
- CLick install from the dialog that appears or
- Once it is open, press `cmd+s` or File > Save and save it as New File and press enter. 

That's it.
## How
1. Right click on any folder and you should see a New File option inside the services menu.
2. Click it, and voila, the directory now has a new file inside it! If you have a lot of Services already, the New File option will be under the Services right click fly out menu like this:
3. You need to be able to right click in the white space of a folder (between the icons and such) and create a new file as well
